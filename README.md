=== Janux Web Seed

A seed project containing an html/css/js project that uses less.js,
semantic-grid, and pure-css.  Built using gulp.

Functionality is based on the yeoman webapp project, but the directory structure
is different.

To run for development:

  $ npm install
  $ gulp serve  : runs a connect server + watch

The default gulp task will do a clean build, but will not run a server.
