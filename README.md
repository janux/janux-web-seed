Janux Web Seed
--------------

A seed project containing an html/css/js project that uses less.js, and
semantic-grid, and pure-css.  Built using gulp.

Functionality is loosely based on the yeoman webapp project, but the directory structure
is different.

To run for development:
```
  $ npm install
  $ gulp watch    // runs a connect server + watch
```

The default gulp task will do a clean build, but will not run a server.
