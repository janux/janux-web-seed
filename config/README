This directory contains configuration files for the gulp build.  The
build relies on the node.js 'config' package at 

    project: https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config
    docs:    http://lorenwest.github.io/node-config/latest

In short, 'config' makes it possible to externalize the parameters that vary on a per-deployment
basis (production, staging, local, etc...), so that a custom configuration can be stored along with
the environment, and files under source-control do not have to be changed to fit an environment.

If you want to change values in your local configuration, simply copy 

    default.js
to
    development.js

and override any parameters in default.js that you want to customize.
