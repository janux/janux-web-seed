 * This would be the way to import the file from the vendor folder:

 *   @import (less) 'pure/pure.css';

 * - the (less) keyword forces less to treat the file as a less file, and will thus inline it into
 *   the resulting css files
 * - the pb with this syntax is that gulp-recess complains and issues a linting error
 * For the time being we are renaming pure.css to src/css/pure/pure.less as a workaround
